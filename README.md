MALWARE CLASSIFICATION APPROACHES UTILIZING BINARY AND TEXT ENCODING OF PERMISSIONS
All experiments were developed by Tensorflow and Keras, different libraries must be installed before running the code such as Kerasclassifer ,sklearn, tensorflow, pretty
Each experiment of classification approaches  required the preparation of encoded permissions binary and  text encoded to classify malware in three datasets
